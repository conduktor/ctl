    The Conduktor Gateway REST API 's aim is to help you configure your Gateway.

    The legacy (v1) API is available but deprecated ([V1 documentation](./?apiVersion=v1)).

    Get started with Conduktor Gateway [self-hosted](https://docs.conduktor.io/gateway/installation/) today. Setup takes only a few minutes.
- name: Authentication
  description: |-
    Authentication to the API requires a basic authentication.

    To get a token and use it you must go through the following steps:

    * Configure the admin password in the Gateway YAML configuration file.

    * Use the password in the **authorization** header of your requests.

    Example:

    ```shell
    curl -X GET "https://your.gateway-api.host/gateway/v2/virtual-cluster" \
          -H "accept: application/json" \
          --user "admin:password"
    ```

    ### Definition

    Kinds the resource types of the Conduktor gateway.

    ### Conduktor Gateway Kinds

    The following kinds are available in the Conduktor Gateway API:

    * `VirtualCluster`
    * `AliasTopic`
    * `ConcentratedTopic`
    * `ConcentrationRule`
    * `Interceptor`
    * `Plugin`
    * `GatewayServiceAccount`
    * `Token`
    * `GatewayGroup`
- name: Api Groups
  description: |+
    ### Definition

    API groups a set of resources that share the same API path prefix. They are used to organize the API endpoints and the
    resources they manage.
    The versioning is set at this level, so all the resources in the same group share the same version.

    ### Conduktor Api Groups

    The Gateway API consist of a single API group right now (`gateway`), and it manages the following resources:

    | Api Group  | Version | Kinds                                                                                                                                                     |
    |------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `/gateway` | `/v2`   | `/virtual-cluster`, `/alias-topic`, `/concentrated-topic`, `/concentration-rule`, </br> `/interceptor`, `/plugin`, `/service-account`, `/group`, `/token` |



- name: Versioning
  description: |+
    * __The version is set at the api group level__. It is incremented when a breaking change happens in the schema of an endpoint of the group (that has been marked `stable`). The n-1 version is still available for a while to allow users to migrate. The version is part of the endpoint path.
    * The API version (v2) is the global version of the Conduktor Gateway API, it should not change unless there is a complete overhaul of the API.


    Endpoint also have a status to manage their API lifecycle, following the order below:
    * __preview__: this is an early-stage feature, really likely to change
    * __beta__: early access feature, breaking change
    * __stable__: Production-ready endpoint, no breaking change
    * __deprecated__: This endpoint isn't supported anymore and the user should migrate


- name: Conventions
  description: |+
    ### Path conventions

    The API follows as much as possible the endpoints structure below for each kind of resource:

    * `GET /{api-group}/{version}/{kind}/{name}` to read a resource
    * `GET /{api-group}/{version}/{kind}` to list resources of a kind
    * `PUT /{api-group}/{version}/{kind}` to update or create a resource
    * `DELETE /{api-group}/{version}/{kind}/{name}` to delete a resource (returns 204 No Content)
    * `POST` is used for specific operations that don't fit this CRUD model. PUT is the default verb for updates and
      creations.
    * Important principle: the result of a GET can be reused as the body of a PUT to update the resource.

    __Non-unique names__:
    When a `name` is not enough to uniquely identify a resource, the GET and DELETE endpoint are different
    The GET by name is replaced by query parameters (returning lists or the searched item if the criteria are the elements
    of the key), and the DELETE by name is replaced by a DELETE with a body.
    For example, an `alias-topic` is identified by its `name` and the `vCluster` gives the following endpoints:

    * `GET /gateway/v2/alias-topic?name={name}&vcluster={vcluster}`
    * `PUT /gateway/v2/alias-topic`
    * `DELETE /gateway/v2/alias-topic` with a body containing the `name` and the `vCluster`

    ### Other conventions

    * All requests and responses are in JSON and should have their `content-type` header set to `application/json`
    * Every kind has a lower-cased name (e.g. `virtual-cluster` for the `VirtualCluster` kind) that is used in the endpoint
      path.
    * Errors have a standard format:
        * The HTTP status code is used to indicate the type of error.
        * The response body contains a common JSON object for every error:
            * `title`: a unique error code for the error.
            * `message`: a human-readable message for the error.
            * `cause`: additional information about the error.
    * All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format.

- name: token
  description: |+
    ### Definition

    The token group contains just a utility endpoint to generate a token for a given Local ServiceAccount (on a given
    virtual cluster, or `passthrough` if omitted).

    This token can be used to authenticate against the Gateway API in the `sasl_plaintext` authentication mode.
    More information on this case here : https://docs.conduktor.io/gateway/concepts/Clients/#sasl_plaintext

    ### Available operations

    * Generate a token

    ### Available operations

    * List service accounts
    * Upsert a service account
    * Delete a service account

    ### Identity

    The service account is identified by the `name` and the `vCluster`.

    The `vCluster` name is not mandatory, but if omitted, the `passthrough` virtual cluster will be used.
    Thus, a service account is always associated with one and only one virtual cluster.

    ### Local and external service accounts

    A service account can be `Local` or `External`.

    * A `Local` service account is just a local user that allows to generate Gateway tokens for your Kafka client
      applications (SASL).
    * An `External` service account is a user that is authenticated by an external system (OIDC). In such a
      scenario you will only need to create external service accounts in 2 cases : either to rename the OIDC principal
      for you Kafka applications OR to gather service accounts into `Groups`. Gateway Tokens are not issued for external
      service accounts since the authentication must be done by the external system.

    To create an external service account you must provide have an `principal` that is the name of the user in the
    external system.
    It can be equal or not to the service account `name` (up to you), but note that __the `principal` must be unique
    across all virtual clusters__.

    ### Schema

    * Get a group
    * Upsert a group
    * Delete a group

    ### Identity

    The group is identified by its `name` (unique across all the virtual clusters).

    A group can be added external groups (coming from LDAP, OIDC claims etc.) which will allow the Gateway to bind them on the Gateway Group.

                  ## Introduction

                  This interceptor slows responses from the brokers.

                  It will operate only on a set of topics rather than all traffic.

                  This interceptor only works on Produce requests and Fetch requests.

                  ## Configuration

                  | key           | type    | default | description                                                     |
                  |:--------------|:--------|:--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
                  | topic         | String  | `.*`    | Topics that match this regex will have the interceptor applied. |
                  | rateInPercent | int     |         | The percentage of requests that will apply this interceptor     |
                  | minLatencyMs  | int     |         | Minimum for the random response latency in milliseconds         |
                  | maxLatencyMs  | int     |         | Maximum for the random response latency in milliseconds         |

                  ## Example

                  ```json
                  {
                    "name": "mySimulateSlowProducersConsumersInterceptor",
                    "pluginClass": "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.chaos.SimulateSlowProducersConsumersPlugin",
